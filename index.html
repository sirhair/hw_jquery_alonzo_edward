    <p><span class="seoSummary">The CSS3 <strong>Flexible Box</strong>, or <strong>flexbox</strong>, is a <a href="/en-US/docs/CSS/Layout_mode" title="/en-US/docs/CSS/Layout_model">layout mode</a> providing for the arrangement of elements on a page such that the elements behave predictably when the page layout must accommodate different screen sizes and different display devices.</span> For many applications, the flexible box model provides an improvement over the block model in that it does not use floats, nor do the flex container's margins collapse with the margins of its contents.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Many designers will find the flexbox model easier to use. Child elements in a flexbox can be laid out in any direction and can have flexible dimensions to adapt to the display space. Positioning child elements is thus much easier, and complex layouts can be achieved more simply and with cleaner code, as the display order of the elements is independent of their order in the source code. This independence intentionally affects only the visual rendering, leaving speech order and navigation based on the source order.</p>

    <div class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Though <a class="external external-icon" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-flexbox/">CSS Flexible Boxes Layout specification</a> is at the Last Call Working Draft stage (see also the <a class="external external-icon" href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-flexbox/">Latest Editor draft</a>), not all browsers have implemented all features of Flexbox. <span style="line-height: 1.5;">That said, there is now a good support across the board of flexbox. See the compatibility table on each property for an up-to-date compatibility status.</span></div>

    <h2 id="Flexible_boxes_concept">Flexible boxes concept</h2>

    <p>The defining aspect of the flex layout is the ability to alter its items' width and/or height to best fill the available space on any display device. A flex container expands items to fill available free space, or shrinks them to prevent overflow.</p>

    <p>The flexbox layout algorithm is direction-agnostic as opposed to the block layout, which is vertically-biased, or the inline layout, which is horizontally-biased. While the block layout works well for pages, it lacks sufficient definition to support application components that have to change orientation, resize, stretch, or shrink as the user agent changes, flips from vertical to horizontal, and so forth. Flexbox layout is most appropriate for the components of an application, and small-scale layouts, while the (emerging) Grid layout is intended for larger scale layouts. Both are part of a wider effort of the CSS Working Group to provide for greater interoperability of web applications with different user agents, different writing modes, and other demands on flexibility.</p>

    <h2 id="Flexible_boxes_vocabulary">Flexible boxes vocabulary</h2>

    <p>While a discussion of flexible boxes is liberated from terms like&nbsp;horizontal/inline axis and vertical/block axis, it requires a new terminology to properly describe the model. Consider the following diagram when reviewing the vocabulary items below. It shows a flex container that has a <code>flex-direction</code> of <code>row</code>, meaning that the flex items follow each other horizontally across the main axis according to the established writing mode, the direction in which the element's text flows, in this case left-to-right.</p>

    <p></p>

    <dl>
     <dt>Flex container</dt>
     <dd>The parent element in which flex items are contained. A flex container is defined using the&nbsp;<code>flex</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>inline-flex</code>&nbsp;values of the&nbsp;<a href="/en/CSS/display" rel="internal" title="display"><code>display</code></a>&nbsp;property.</dd>

     <p>Every flexible box layout follows two axes. The <strong>main axis</strong> is the axis along which the flex items follow each other. The&nbsp;<strong>cross axis</strong> is the axis perpendicular to the <strong>main axis</strong>.</p>

     </ul>
     </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2 id="Designating_a_flexible_box">Designating a flexible box</h2>

    <p>To designate the CSS for elements using this style, set&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="/en/CSS/display" title="/en/CSS/display">display</a>&nbsp;property as follows:</p>

    <pre class="brush: css  language-css" data-number=""><code class=" language-css"><span class="token property">display</span> <span class="token punctuation">:</span> flex<div class="line-number" data-start="1" style="top: 0px;"></div></code></pre>

    <p>or</p>

    <pre class="brush: css  language-css" data-number=""><code class=" language-css"><span class="token property">display</span> <span class="token punctuation">:</span> inline-flex<div class="line-number" data-start="1" style="top: 0px;"></div></code></pre>

    <p>Doing so defines the element as a flex container and its children as flex items.&nbsp;The&nbsp;<code>flex</code>&nbsp;value makes the flex container a block-level element. The&nbsp;<code>inline-flex</code>&nbsp;value makes the flex container an atomic inline-level element.</p>

    <div class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For the vendor prefix tag, append the string on the display property, not on the display attribute itself. For example,&nbsp;<code>display : -webkit-flex</code>.</div>

    <h2 id="Flex_item_considerations">Flex item considerations</h2>

    <p>Text that is directly contained inside a flex container is automatically wrapped in an anonymous flex item. However, an anonymous flex item that contains only white space is not rendered, as if it were designated&nbsp;<code style="color: rgb(93,86,54); font-size: 14px;">display:none</code>.</p>

    <p>Absolutely positioned children of a flex container are positioned so that their static position is determined in reference to the main start content-box corner of their flex container.</p>

    <p>Currently, due to a known issue, specifying&nbsp;<code style="font-size: 14px;">visibility:collapse</code>&nbsp;on a flex item causes it to be treated as if it were&nbsp;<code style="font-size: 14px;">display:none</code>&nbsp;instead of the intended behavior, treating it as if it were&nbsp;<code style="font-size: 14px;">visibility:hidden</code>. The suggested workaround until this issue is resolved is to use <code>visibility:hidden</code> for flex items that should behave as if they were designated&nbsp;<code>visibility:collapse</code>. For more information, see <a class="external external-icon" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=783470" title="FIXED: implement &quot;visibility: collapse&quot; behavior on flexbox">bug&nbsp;783470</a>.</p>

    <p>The margins of adjacent flex items do not collapse. Using <code>auto</code> margins absorbs extra space in the vertical or horizontal direction and can be used for alignment or to separate adjacent flex items. See <a class="external external-icon" href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-flexbox/#auto-margins" title="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-flexbox/#auto-margins">Aligning with 'auto' margins</a>&nbsp;in the W3C Flexible Box Layout Model specification for more details.</p>

    <p><strike>To ensure a reasonable default minimum size for flex items, use <code>min-width:auto</code> and/or <code>min-height:auto</code>. For flex items, the <code>auto</code> attribute value calculates the minimum width/height of the item to be no less than the width/height of its content, guaranteeing that the item is rendered large enough to hold the content. See <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/min-width" title="The min-width CSS property is used to set the minimum width of a given element. It prevents the used value of the width property from becoming smaller than the value specified for min-width."><code>min-width</code></a>&nbsp; and <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/min-height" title="The min-height CSS property is used to set the minimum height of a given element. It prevents the used value of the height property from becoming smaller than the value specified for min-height."><code>min-height</code></a> for more details.</strike></p>

    <p>Flexbox's alignment properties do "true" centering, unlike other centering methods in CSS. This means that the flex items will stay centered, even if they overflow the flex container. This can sometimes be problematic, however, if they overflow past the top edge of the page, or the left edge (in LTR languages like English; the problem occurs on the right edge in RTL languages like Arabic), as you can't scroll to that area, even if there is content there! In a future release, the alignment properties will be extended to have a "safe" option as well. For now, if this is a concern, you can instead use margins to achieve centering, as they'll respond in a "safe" way and stop centering if they overflow. Instead of using the <code>align-</code> properties, just put auto margins on the flex items you wish to center. Instead of the <code>justify-</code> properties, put auto margins on the outside edges of the first and last flex items in the flex container. The auto margins will "flex" and assume the leftover space, centering the flex items when there is leftover space, and switching to normal alignment when not. However, if you're trying to replace <code>justify-content</code> with margin-based centering in a multi-line flexbox, you're probably out of luck, as you need to put the margins on the first and last flex item on each line. Unless you can predict ahead of time which items will end up on which line, you can't reliably use margin-based centering in the main axis to replace the <code>justify-content</code> property.</p>

    <p>Recall that while the display order of the elements is independent of their order in the source code, this independence affects only the visual rendering, leaving speech order and navigation based on the source order. Even the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/order" title="The CSS order property specifies the order used to lay out flex items in their flex container. Elements are laid out by ascending order of the order value. Elements with the same order value are laid out in the order they appear in the source code."><code>order</code></a> property does not affect speech or navigation sequence. Thus developers must take care to order elements properly in the source so as not to&nbsp;damage the document's accessibility.&nbsp;</p>

    <h2 id="Things_to_keep_in_mind">Things to keep in mind</h2>

    <p>The algorithm describing how flex items are laid out can be pretty tricky at times. Here are a few things to consider to avoid bad surprises when designing using flexible boxes.</p>

    <p>Flexibles boxes are laid out in conformance of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/writing-mode" title="mode">writing mode</a>, which means that <strong>main start</strong> and <strong>main end</strong> are laid out according to the position of <strong>start</strong> and <strong>end</strong>.</p>

    <p><strong>cross start</strong> and <strong>cross end</strong> rely on the definition of the <strong>start</strong> or <strong>before</strong> position that depends on the value of <a href="/en/CSS/direction" title="direction"><code>direction</code></a>.</p>

    <p>Page breaks are possible in flexible boxes layout as long as <code>break-</code> property allows it. CSS3 <code>break-after</code>, <code>break-before</code>, and <code>break-inside</code> as well as CSS 2.1 <code>page-break-before</code>, <code>page-break-after</code>, and <code>page-break-inside</code> properties are accepted on a flex container, flex items, and inside flex items.</p>

    <h3 id="Notes">Notes</h3>

    <p>[1] Safari up to 6.0 ( 6.1 for iOS ) supported an old incompatible draft version of the specification. Safari 6.1( 7 for iOS ) has been updated to support the final version.</p>

    <p>[2] Up to Firefox 22, to activate flexbox support, the user has to change the about:config preference "layout.css.flexbox.enabled" to <code>true</code>. From Firefox 22 to Firefox 27, the preference is <code>true</code> by default, but the preference has been removed in Firefox 28.</p>

    <p>[3] Internet Explorer 10 supports an old incompatible draft version of the specification; Internet Explorer 11 <a class="external external-icon" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/dn265027%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">has been updated</a> to support the final version.</p>
